description: I am a qualified neuropsychologist and a cognitive scientist trying to understand how humans make sense of time. During my PhD, I worked on the representation and processing of abstract temporal concepts such as past and future. Currently, I am heading towards using a combination of behavioural, neurophysiological, and computational methods to examine how humans understand, feel, and estimate time. I am a passionate researcher doing my best, who loves talking about science and who is always in quest of learning and understanding new things, so please do not hesitate to contact me!
